# Run `make` with no arguments to view possible actions.
#
# NB: This Makefile is mostly linux-only.
#
# Why this file ? (when you already use poetry/pyproject.toml)
# ----------------
# 	Poetry not only deals with dependency resolution.
# It also handles packaging/distribution. But, only for PyPI (pip).
# 	So how are "applications" (vs "libraries") to be packaged?
# Using pipx? Distributing as .deb package? What about MacOS? etc. Ref:
# https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/#freezing-your-code-ref
# Remember, they need to create an isolated python environment,
# and download (or vendorize) dependencies.
# 	Similarly, how should it be installed from source (github),
# for the purpose of development?
# One alternative is to state that poetry is prerequisite.
# Another way is to provide this makefile, since (GNU) make
# is pretty universal. This makefile takes care of
# - Poetry installation
# - Venv activation (with poetry)
# - Task running (invoker), avoiding the necessity for
#   multiple small scripts for testing, cleaning, linting, publishing, etc.
#   Note that task execution might be handled by poetry in the future:
#   https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/40 .
# - Providing (fairly readable) recipies
#
# Makefile syntax:
# ----------------
# - cheatsheet: https://devhints.io/makefile
# - Must use tabs to prefix the action parts of rules!
# - .PHONY is used to declare targets that don't yield (epynomous) files.
#   For example, w/o this, the tests will not run if a `test` dir exists
#   Related note: targets without deps always run, unless they're shaded by a file/dir.
# - Directory timestamps don't change upon file changes => use `find`, e.g.:
#   hello: $(shell find $(SRC) -type f)
#   	@echo "Hello World" > hello

# Project-specific
SRC:=mpl_tools
TESTS:=tests

# - Some sensible defaults from https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/
